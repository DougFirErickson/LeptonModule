ThermalVew is a program used to read seial data from the stm32nucleo_401re example code. 

The program uses the MingGW toolchain for compiling the code.  http://www.mingw.org/
once the toolchain has been installed and added to the path, make all can be used to compile to an exe. 

The program has a hardcoded serial port, it needs to be modified to change the serial port com port. 


some issues:  the program needs an obj folder for the compiled object code be compiled, so if you see an issue, create a folder called obj
